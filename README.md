# Friend Forum
 
## Overview

In this application, the user is able to login, make a profile, and chat about eight predefined topics as well as in a global conversation. With our link tracking feature, the user will not have to go scrolling through an entire conversation to find a source one of his or her friends shared, as it is automatically stored in a separate list.  Finally, there is a news API to provide a feed of relevant top trending articles within the scope of the predefined topics.

Socket.Io was the main node package used in this website. A separate table was made for each of the different chats to keep them each separate.

## Future Developments 

In the future, it would be interesting to have a single table to hold all chats and simply add a new column to contain the new text, author, and category name. Additionally, we'd like to implement a more robust user search feature.
